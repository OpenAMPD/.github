# OpenAMPD
Welcome to Open Archive of Middle Persian Documents (OpenAMPD), a project working to digitise the Middle Persian documents that have so
far been edited. The Middle Persian documents are mostly economic and administrative in nature. The Middle Persian documents are variously 
preserved on parchment, papyrus and textiles. While these elude a precise dating, research indicates that they belong to the late Sasanian
and early Islamic era. The earliest of these date from the Sasanian occupation of Egypt and are thus more securely located in time (618–629 CE).
Geographically the documents hail from the Fayyūm oasis in Egypt, central Iran and Tabaristān in the North of the country.

It is often assumed that the Middle Persian literature, despite its younger age,
preserves Sasanian ideas and thought. While this assumption may be true, reli-
gious literature and theological speculation inevitably reflect the perspective of a
narrow sliver of a society, in this case the Zoroastrian priesthood, which was eager
to preserve its religious heritage in the midst of a changing society. By contrast,
the Middle Persian documents—administrative and economic documents, as well as
private communications—bear direct witness to the broader realities of their own
time. Intimately preoccupied with issues of daily life, they open a window onto
Iranian society otherwise unknown from the Middle Persian literature.

OpenAMPD was conceived by Adam Benkato and Arash Zeini and is currently supported by Mohsen Mahdavi Mazdeh. It is our aim to make all known documents
publicly available.
